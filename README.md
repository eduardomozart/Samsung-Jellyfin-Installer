  <b>Apps2Samsung</b> is a small cross-platform tool that side-loads <b>any app</b> onto <b>Samsung devices running Tizen OS</b> — Smart TVs, projectors and smart monitors —
  <a href="https://jellyfin.org">Jellyfin</a>, Moonlight, Moonfin, Litefin and the whole <a href="https://github.com/Apps2Samsung/tizen-community-packages">community catalog</a>, or your own <code>.wgt</code>.
  <br/>
  It handles device detection, certificates, and installation so you don’t have to fight with Tizen Studio or manual sideloading.

### 📱 Get the Android app (auto-updating)

The phone app is the mobile installer head — run the whole install from your phone.

- **Obtainium** — tracks this repo's GitHub releases and updates automatically when a new **stable** is published. Add it with one tap:
  [Add to Obtainium](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://add/https://github.com/Apps2Samsung/Apps2Samsung), or paste `https://github.com/Apps2Samsung/Apps2Samsung` into Obtainium's *Add App*.

## 🚀 How It Works (Short Version)

Before you begin, ensure your Samsung TV is in Developer Mode. This is required to install apps on it.

👉 [How to enable Developer Mode on your TV](https://github.com/Apps2Samsung/Apps2Samsung/wiki/FAQ#-how-to-enable-developer-mode-on-your-tv)

1. Run the tool on your computer
2. Select your Samsung TV
3. Pick an app (Jellyfin, the community catalog, or a custom `.wgt`)
4. Install

That’s it. No manual certificate handling required in most cases.

**NixOS:** Clone the repository and run `nix-shell` — the shell environment will automatically build and launch the tool.
